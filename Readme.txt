Requirements:
The chat service uses python 3.7.2
It also uses the following libraries:
Bcrypt, Sqlite3, Sys, Os and Time
The three latter, should come with python.

The program should be run from python in a terminal. I used CMD, but others will work as well

Features:
The service allows user to chat with eachother, after logging in.
The passwords are encrypted with Bcrypt. Unfortunately, the messages are not yet encrypted.

To login, you will need one of the following sets of credentials:
Sherlock - 1234
Watson - Hamish
Mycroft - Eurus

Once logged in, a simple ui, will allow you to either refresh the messages, send a new message or log out.
